            "First, a group tour has its own strict schedule and all the tour team members should follow it. And it means that I can not choose the place where I want go and the food which I want to eat. For example, when I went to Thailand for the first time, I chose a group tour because I was young and it was the first time to go abroad. I really wanted to go many attractive shops and spots in the street in Bangkok, but I couldn't go there because I was in a group tour and I had to follow the schedule which the tour company offered. And I had to wake up early in the morning and had to go back to hotel in early evening, even though I wanted to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morning and wanted to go outside in the night. It was really bad experience. \n",

            "Second, a group tour does not offer many opportunities to meet other people for its tour team members. Becuase a group tour moves together by its tour bus, it is difficult to meet many people in new places. But if I travel alone, I can meet many people and feel their cultures. When I went to Tokyo by myself, I met really many people there. I could talk with them and some of them became my friends! Even though I could not go a lot of sightseeing spots as efficiently as a group tour, choosing a place where I go and going there by a subway were really exciting experience and Japanese people were kind to let me know the ways. \n",

            "It is an important decision, how to plan your syllabus. Some students prefer to take a lot of courses and expand their knowledge, whereas some other prefer to specialize in one specific subject. In this essay I will dwell on the advantages of specializing in one subject and argue in its favor.\n",
            "There are at least three reasons why choosing one subject is better than trying to keep balance between many subjects. The first and most important reason for me is that this way people concentrate on one thing and do not feel anxiety about time-management and deadlines. In contrast, student who take three or four subjects are very busy and stressed, because they have to prepare for many exams and see different lecturers, which is confusing and the results are not as good as those of the ones from the one subject plan. In addition, when one specializes in one subject then this person has more chances to be well-informed about it and do his best, being sure he recieves the best knowledge and invests in something substantial and prosperious.The second reason is that this kind of studying gives the opportunity to work and gain your own money. Usually students depend on their parents and have to explain why they need money, which is not very pleasant. For instance, I used to work when i did not have many lessons and I was happy that I was able to succeed in working and doing something important as an adult does, relying on my own experience. The third reason is that the students can pay more attention to their relatives, friends and even their hobbies. Moreover, life is not only studying and if we cannot enjoy it, we should rethink our point of view. For example, students, who do not have fun and only study, get sick and miss the both chances. The psychologies have proved that working hard is not the best for our health and we should take rest from time to time. \n",
            "In my opinion, it is better to specialize in one subject, because this choice makes us have more healthy life, which has is successful too. \n",

            "It is an important decision, how to plan your syllabus. Some students prefer to take a lot of courses and expand their knowledge, whereas some other prefer to specialize in one specific subject. In this essay I will dwell on the advantages of specializing in one subject and argue in its favor.\n",
            "There are at least three reasons why choosing one subject is better than trying to keep balance between many subjects. The first and most important reason for me is that this way people concentrate on one thing and do not feel anxiety about time-management and deadlines. In contrast, student who take three or four subjects are very busy and stressed, because they have to prepare for many exams and see different lecturers, which is confusing and the results are not as good as those of the ones from the one subject plan. In addition, when one specializes in one subject then this person has more chances to be well-informed about it and do his best, being sure he recieves the best knowledge and invests in something substantial and prosperious.The second reason is that this kind of studying gives the opportunity to work and gain your own money. Usually students depend on their parents and have to explain why they need money, which is not very pleasant. For instance, I used to work when i did not have many lessons and I was happy that I was able to succeed in working and doing something important as an adult does, relying on my own experience. The third reason is that the students can pay more attention to their relatives, friends and even their hobbies. Moreover, life is not only studying and if we cannot enjoy it, we should rethink our point of view. For example, students, who do not have fun and only study, get sick and miss the both chances. The psychologies have proved that working hard is not the best for our health and we should take rest from time to time. \n",

When you travel in a group it is very easy to get to know other people because usually you sit in the same bus or you sleep in the same hotel like the others do. That is why you are never borring when you travel in groups. \n",

When you are not able to speak the language people in the country you visit speak, then the tour guide can help you because he has to be able to speak it.

For example, when I went to Thailand for the first time, I chose a group tour because I was young and it was the first time to go abroad. I really wanted to go many attractive shops and spots in the street in Bangkok, but I couldn't go there because I was in a group tour and I had to follow the schedule which the tour company offered. And I had to wake up early in the morning and had to go back to hotel in early evening, even though I wanted to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morning and wanted to go outside in the night. It was really bad experience. \n",

Becuase a group tour moves together by its tour bus, it is difficult to meet many people in new places. But if I travel alone, I can meet many people and feel their cultures. When I went to Tokyo by myself, I met really many people there. I could talk with them and some of them became my friends! Even though I could not go a lot of sightseeing spots as efficiently as a group tour, choosing a place where I go and going there by a subway were really exciting experience and Japanese people were kind to let me know the ways. \n",
